You're still a friend of mine
We met on Chapman in Catalina

And you're always so fly
But you can't start a war just for the feeling

Lovely sewer, tragedy free
In love with the frenzy
We stared at our ceilings
Always the last to arrive, the first to leave
The smallest flicker of light
You left in a frenzy

Lovely sewer, tragedy free
You cannot start a war
Just for the feeling
What if our friends see?
We stared at our ceilings
The smallest flicker of light, ooh, yeah
